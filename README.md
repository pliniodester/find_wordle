# find_wordle

This is just a tentative of developing an algorithm to solve the popular game Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) efficiently.

In find_wordle_mean.py we try a mean approach, i.e., we guess a word for which we have the least expected number of possible words for the next guess

In find_wordle_minmax.py we try a minmax approach, i.e., we guess a word for which we have the best worst-case scenario for the next guess
